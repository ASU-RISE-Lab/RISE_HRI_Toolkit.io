# Control for HRI
Control engineering is an inevitable part of every field in robotics and human-robot interaction is not an exception.
Control itself is a really broad field of engineering with different applications and it has so many different branches such as optimal control, robust control, adaptive control, nonlinear control and etc. Also, modern control sometimes it has a really powerful connection with reinforcement learning, deep learning and game theory.
Here, we are going to introduce some of these subcategories with so many applications in HRI.
