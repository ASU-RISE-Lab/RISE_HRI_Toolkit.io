# Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement Learning is another machine learning method that is based on the idea of learning by interacting with the environment. Reinforcement learning problems involve what to do or how to map situations to actions so as to maximize a reward signal in long term. A reinforcement learning problem is different from other machine learning methods that are based on learning from labeled data, A reinforcement learning agent learns from interaction with its encironment an the reward signal that it gets from the environment, not from labeled data, and from this prespective it is more similar to optimal control problems.
Reinforcement learning research is certainly one of the most important part of the way toward the future of AI and HRI.
## Deep Learning\

[Deep learning with Python and Tensor Flow](https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-deep-learning-python-tensorflow-keras/)
Link to the first few application of deep learning for classification of images are available [here](https://github.com/sunamatya/Deep_learning_tutorials)

### Deep Q Network\
The DQN (Deep Q-Network) algorithm was developed by DeepMind in 2015.
 DQN combining reinforcement learning and deep neural networks at scale. 
 The algorithm was developed by enhancing a classic RL algorithm called Q-Learning with deep neural networks and a technique called **experience replay**.\
 Some of the resources available to learn Deep Q Network in concurrence with RL is [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/tutorials/0_intro_rl)
 Understanding how DQN networks are made can be confusing and tiresome, one of the tutorials that takes time explaining all the layers for defining a deep network
 can be found [here](https://pythonprogramming.net/deep-q-learning-dqn-reinforcement-learning-python-tutorial/)
 The tutorial is a five part series for understanding Reinforcement Learning with Python and extensively uses TensorFlow with Keras.
 With the new version of the Tensorflow, the available code may have some issue with the ModifiedTensorBoard. A functioning code in the Blob Environment is available [here] (https://github.com/sunamatya/Deep_learning_tutorials/blob/main/dqn-1.py)
