# Reinforcement Learning

## Deep Learning\

[Deep learning with Python and Tensor Flow](https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-deep-learning-python-tensorflow-keras/)

### Deep Q Network\
The DQN (Deep Q-Network) algorithm was developed by DeepMind in 2015.
 DQN combining reinforcement learning and deep neural networks at scale. 
 The algorithm was developed by enhancing a classic RL algorithm called Q-Learning with deep neural networks and a technique called **experience replay**.\
 Some of the resources available to learn Deep Q Network in concurrence with RL is [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/tutorials/0_intro_rl)
