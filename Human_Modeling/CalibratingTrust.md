# Mutual Adaptation
Typically robot policies are found to comply and supplement human preferences. This is sufficient for most cases of human-robot interation (HRI) since the human is genrally considered to be a good maximizers of task rewards.  However, what happens when the human is behaving suboptimally according the the robot's reward function? In these cases there are several questions that the must be adressed when interecting:

1. Should the robot intervene to mitigate the effect of suboptimal behavior in team performance?
2. Should the robot comply with the human to preserve their relationship (trust) and improve future team performance?
3. Is the human truely suboptimal or do they just look that way to the robot's assumed reward and limited generalizability?  

One approach to the answering the first two questions is to balance a tradeoff between team performance and preserved trust based on the _adaptability_ of the human. The following studies look at how we can approach interacting with humans that behave unexpectedly according to the robot's reward function.
