title: Sensors for HRI Applications
---
The artificial sensors used for HRI applications can be identified in four main categories: Vision, Touch, Auditory, and Distance. []\

# Vision 
In robotic vision, images taken by cameras are processed to produce numeric or symbolic information used to understand the environment and human intention, as well as  to reproduce human sight.

## Visial Servoing
Visual servoing refers to the use of vision to control the robot motion []. The camera may be mounted on a moving part of the robot, or fixed in the workspace. Visual servoing is called image-based when the the error and states are defined in image space, or its called position based when they are defined in 3D operational space. \
 In HRI, humans generally use vision to teach the robot specific configurations or sending the desired reference view []. In assistive robotics, visual servoing has been used to correct user trajectories [].


 # Touch 
 Touch sensing includes both proprioceptive force and tact, with the latter involving direct physical contact with an external object.
 ## Proprioceptive Force Sensing
 Proprioceptive force sensing is analogous to the sense of muscle force []. These forces can be measured using the position error (elastic systems) or torque sensors embeded in the robot joints. These forces can be used to etimate and infer human intenstions, and performin force control. 
 ## Tactile Sensors
 Tactile sensors are useful for detecting the geometry, texture, presence, and position of touched objects. They can also collect additional information, including force strain, shear, flexion, torsion, and vibration. Using tactile sensors can enable more precise and safe human-machine interaction.

### Types of Tactile Sensors
 - Electrical
    - Piezoresistive: Mechanical stimuli change the shape of a crystal, resulting in a change in resistance.
    - Resistive: Applied pressure results in a change in contact resistance between two textile elements. This approach suffers from high drift and hysteresis, but may be useful for flexible tactile sensing.
    - Capacitive: Mechanical stimuli changes capacitance by compressing the dielectric material.
    - Triboelectric: Relies on the conversion of mechanical energy to  electrical energy by electrostatic induction between two different materiols. Triboelectric sensors are particularly useful for self-powered applications.
 - Optical
   - Index-based: Uses properties of light to detect changes due to tactile interaction
   - Camera-based: Uses a CCD sensor to monitor changes in light intensity
