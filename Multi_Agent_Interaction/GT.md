title: Game Theory 
Game theory provides a formal language for the representation and analysis of interactive situations, that is, situations where several “entities”, called players, take actions that affect each other. The nature of the players varies depending on the context in which the game theoretic language is invoked: in evolutionary biology (see, for example, John Maynard Smith, 1982) players are non-thinking living organisms; in computer science (see, for example, Shoham-Leyton-Brown, 2008) players are artificial agents; in behavioral game theory (see, for example, Camerer, 2003) players are “ordinary” human beings, etc. Traditionally, however, game theory has focused on interaction among intelligent, sophisticated and rational individuals.
Game theory is divided into two main branches. The first is cooperative game theory, which assumes that the players can communicate, form coalitions and sign binding agreements. Cooperative game theory has been used, for example, to analyze voting behavior and other issues in political science and related fields.
The other main branch is non-cooperative game theory. Non-cooperative game theory models situations where the players are either unable to communicate or are able to communicate but cannot sign binding contracts. An example of the latter situation is the interaction among firms in an industry in an environment where antitrust laws make it illegal for firms to reach agreements concerning prices or production quotas or other forms of collusive behavior.
