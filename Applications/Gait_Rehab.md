# Introduction 
*The aging population and neurological disorders such as stroke and Parkinsonâ€™s disease lead to increased walking impairments. Traditional gait rehabilitation techniques involve multiple training sessions supervised by physical therapists. This paradigm is physically demanding for therapists, inconvenient for patients, and expensive for the entire healthcare system. Wearable assistive robots have been shown effective in restoring lost motor functions and improve training performance. The goal is to develope intent estimation and adaptive control algorithms to personalize the robot assistance for different users in various tasks.* 


## Wearable Robots (Exoskeletons)
Lower-limb exoskeletons need to be light-weight,compact, powerfull enough to assist gait and lower-limb motions, safe and reliable. Series-elastic actuators, cable-driven, pneumatic, and variable stiffness are among the widely used mechanisms to reach those goals.  
Both sigle and multi joints wearble robots can be used, depending on the gait impairment and assistance goal.
