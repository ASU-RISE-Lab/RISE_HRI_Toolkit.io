# Introduction 
Robots have recently seen advances in sensing and control such that they can now enter the same workspace as humans. This affords a unique opportunity to apply the strengths of humans (general inteligence, flexibility, and contextual awarness) with the strengths of robots (accuracy, repeatability, and endurance). Effectivly implementing a human-robot team (HRT) can premote task efficiency while reducing cost, fatigue driven error, and risk in several applications. The remainder of this page will now explore the tpyes of HRTs as well as the industries and applications that stand to benifit from introducing a robotic teammate.


# Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC)
 We will explore NUMBER types of interection paradigms that is commonly found when disucssing HRC: 1) task handoff, 2) shared task execution,  and 3) shared control

## Task Handoff
Task handoff refers to multiple agents that independantly complete subtasks that accumulate to the final goal of the team. The distingushing feature of this type of interaction is that teammates must be ADD

## Shared Task Execution
Shared task execution refers to multiple agents that simultanously work on the same subtask. In contrast to task handoff, interaction with shared task execution is at such a high frequency, or possibly continous, that each team member must integrate their perceptions of their partner's actions into their low-level control and decision-making. That is to say, a team of this type must be actively aware of the partner's actions so that they can appropriatley adapt their trajectory and intentions to supplement their parnter.  
### Collaborative Assembly
Collaborative assembly in this context implies that a human and robot are operating in a shared enviorment and must actively adapt to their partner and jointly plain their actions in order to effectivley complete the task. Because collision between the robot and human is certainly possible in this type of enviorment, saftey is of particular interest to control of these robotic devices.
