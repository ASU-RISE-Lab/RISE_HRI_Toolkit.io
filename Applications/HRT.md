title: Human Robot Teaming

[Return Home Page](../index.md)
# Introduction 
Robots have recently seen advances in sensing and control such that they can now enter the same workspace as humans. This affords a unique opportunity to apply the strengths of humans (general inteligence, flexibility, and contextual awarness) with the strengths of robots (accuracy, repeatability, and endurance). Effectivly implementing a human-robot team (HRT) can premote task efficiency while reducing cost, fatigue driven error, and risk in several applications. The remainder of this page will now explore industries and applications that stand to benifit from introducing a robotic teammate.
