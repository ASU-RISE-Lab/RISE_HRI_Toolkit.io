# Introduction
Driver behavior or error factor in 94% of crashes, and self-driving vehicles can help reduce driver error. 
Industrial interests in autonomous vehicles is of growing interest with automated deliveries amid safety interests during Covid-19 pandemic.
Autonomous Vehicles need to be **safe** as well as should be able to **interact** with other vehicles in crowded environment.
Often times data driven systems fail to work in previously unseen environment. 
We provide here some of the algorithms AV interactions have been modeled with some of the available datasets.
 
# Available Datasets
* [INTERACTION Dataset](https://interaction-dataset.com/)\
The INTERACTION dataset contains naturalistic motions of various traffic participants in a variety of highly interactive driving scenarios from different countries. 
* [NSGIM Dataset](https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/trafficanalysistools/ngsim.htm)\
NSGIM dataset has been developed with the intention of open behavioral algorithms in support of traffic simulation with a primary focus on microscopic modeling, including supporting documentation and validation data sets that describe the interactions of multimodal travelers, vehicles and highway systems, and interactions presented to them from traffic control devices, delineation, congestion, and other features of the environment.
* [high D](https://www.highd-dataset.com/)\
The highD dataset is a new dataset of naturalistic vehicle trajectories recorded on German highways. Using a drone, typical limitations of established traffic data collection methods such as occlusions are overcome by the aerial perspective.
* [ZEN](https://zen-traffic-data.net/english/outline/dataset.html)\
Zen dataset is from Japan and developed by Hanshin Expressway Company. The data consists of wide range and long period of all vehicle trajectory data and any other data affecting traffic events.
* [AGROVERSE](https://www.argoverse.org/)\
Argoverse is developed by Argo AI, in collaboration with faculty and students from Carnegie Mellon University and Georgia Institute of Technology. One of the first publicly available datasets for research into self-driving vehicle perception, and grew into a larger project to provide high quality curated data and detailed maps to improve 3D tracking and motion forecasting models.
* [WAYMO](https://waymo.com/intl/en_us/dataset-download-terms/)\
The Waymo Open Dataset is a perception dataset comprising high resolution sensor data and labels for 1,950 segments.
